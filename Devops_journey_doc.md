# DevOps_Journey
This journey covers a wide range of DevOps topics, from foundational principles to hands-on projects involving virtualization, Linux server management, and automation. This repository is intended to: 
 - Track my learning progress. 
 - Showcase the tools and technologies I have worked with. 
 - Serve as a reference for others on a similar path.
